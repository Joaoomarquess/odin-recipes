    <h2>The best Spaghetii alla Carbonara you will ever try!!</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. <em>The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle</em>.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound of guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
        <li>16 ounce (or 1 package) of spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 large Eggs</li>
        <li> 10 tablespoons of Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper as seasonings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
